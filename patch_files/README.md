# MPTCP Patch files

Official out-of-tree MPTCP patches only support minor releases of the Linux kernel (starting with 4.9). OpenWrt uses patch releases of that Linux kernel. Because of this reason, you can't use the patches from the official website.

The patch should be in the following location : 
```ruby 
target/linux/generic/hack-5.4/999-mptcp_v0.96.patch
```
After downloading the patch run the following command to apply and check if the patches are fine.
```ruby 
make target/linux/{clean,prepare} V=s
```
